# Multilingual-register-corpora
This repository contains two web corpora with manual register annotations: the French Corpus of Online REgisters (FreCORE) and the Swedish Corpus of Online REgisters (SweCORE) data. The corpora are extracted from the unrestricted open web, and they follow the register taxonomy presented for English in _Register variation online_ by Douglas Biber and Jesse Egbert (2018, Cambridge). 

FreCORE and SweCORE are introduced in the paper 
['Beyond the English Web: Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual and Lightweight Monolingual Classification of Registers'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07396).

The FreCORE and SweCORE annotations are released under Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY). Please cite:
